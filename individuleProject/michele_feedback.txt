When I first open the app, I get the instructions to shake the app, so I know immediately what to do. Then when / why the camera pops up, it is unclear what I should do. I know (because I talked with you about your project), that I should be taking a picture of the MEET value, but if I am looking at the app for the first time, I am never given instructions for what to do once the value pops up. What I would suggest for you is to include instructions for the step where I need to make a picture. It can be as simple as showing the MEET value, then below it in a small textbox writing “When the camera pops up, take a picture.” 

The other problem is that after I take the picture, no matter what I press, the app exits. I suspect this is a bug with your code. You are calling “call close screen” inside of a timer and I suspect this is not doing the right thing. The way to start debugging this is to take out the “call close screen” portion (or maybe Clock2.Timer altogether), and go from there. Unfortunately, because of this bug, I can’t see the app after the camera, since the 5-second timer you wanted to close the camera is not working. 

One last suggestion I have for you is to think about the colors you are choosing for the design of the app - the colors you chose for the background and button colors are a bit hard on the eyes. Choosing colors that go slightly better together go a long way to making the app look a lot more professional. 

If you want to take a look at your app and fix it up a little bit to make it perfect, it would be a nice app for you to have just to show that you made an app. Great job on the project, and I encourage you to work on fixing these small mistakes to make the app as perfect as it can be.
